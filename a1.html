    <h1>Hoon Yu's Assignment 1 - Blink!</h1>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="circuit.jpg" />
      <p>The image of circuit that in which three Red LEDs are 
        blinking independently.
        The Arduino microcontrollers and IDE are used to 
        program the sequence of each blinking.  </p>




    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="BlinkVid.gif" />
      <p> The animated version of thre circuit and breadboard, 
        making three red-LEDs blink all with a different sequence. 
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="header">
      <img src="blinkCode.jpg" />
      <p> The snippet of code in IDE that programs the blinking of red-LEDs.
        As shown, three chunks of code indepnedently controlls the cutomized
        blinking system.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="schematic.jpg" />
      <p> The Schematic of the circuit and calculations for the resistance.
        Three resistors of 220 ohms are used since each red-LEDs require a resistance
        higher than 160 ohms.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="header">
      <img src="question1.jpg" />
      <p> 1. A graph that answers question 1 of Additional questions.<br />

      2. About 8 red-LEDs can blink independently in Arduino. 
        This is because 1 red-LED need about 20mA current, meaning 8 X 20mA = 160mA.
        Since the total current is limited to 200mA, 8 red-LEDs can fully function.
        Again, this will draw the current of 160mA.<br />
        
      4.  In human eyes, you need to blink the LEDs in about 0.05 seconds (meaning delay has a value of 0.05 seconds),
        which is too fast for us to perceive. </p>
