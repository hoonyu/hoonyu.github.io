    <h1>Hoon Yu's Assignment 5 - Higher Voltage and Transistors!</h1>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Higher/circuit.jpg" />
      <p>The image of the circuit showing a coin capacitor, a N-MOSFET transistor, and the 
        DC motor with the fan that behaves based on the input gained by the coin capacitor.
        The Arduino microcontrollers and IDE are used to 
        program the mapping of the coin capcitior synchronized with the intensity of the DC motor.
        *Note that 10K resistor was used for the Coin Capacitive Sensor since using higher resistor value
        will cause the sensor to become extremely sensitive, such that I need to put my finger farther away
        and it will be hard to manage the servo motor. (The schematic should have 10K not 1M resistor).

      <p> The animated version of the circuit, 
        making the DC motor rotate as the finger gets closer to the coin. 
        Notice how the closer the finger gets to the coin, the more motor rotate faster.
        When the certain threshold is reached, the motor starts spinning rapidly.

            <p> The snippet of code in IDE that programs the motion of the DC motor 
                with the synchronization of the coin capacitor.
                As shown, one library: CapacitiveSensor is used.
                *Note that the value of the map function is based on the calibration: 
                According to the result shown in the serial monitor,
                the sensor's minimum value was approximately 20, wheras its maximum value was approximately 600.

      <p> The schematic of the entire circuit and showing how each components are configuered.
        Notice how each coin capacitive sensor and the DC motor is arranged independently.
        According to my calculation, the max current used at the transistor is 0.12A
        (The schematic should have 10K not 1M resistor).

      <p> When I studied the datasheet for the N-MOSFET transsitor, 
        the Maximum Value section indicated that the the absolute max current the transistor can hold is 80A.
