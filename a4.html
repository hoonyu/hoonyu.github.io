      <p>The image of the circuit showing a coin capacitor and the servo motor that behaves 
        based on the input gained by the coin capacitor.
        The Arduino microcontrollers and IDE are used to 
        program the mapping of the coin capcitior synchronized with the angle rotation of the servo motor.
        *Note that 10K resistor was used for the Coin Capacitive Sensor since using higher resistor value
        will cause the sensor to become extremely sensitive, such that I need to put my finger farther away
        and it will be hard to manage the servo motor.

      <p> The animated version of the circuit, 
        making the servo motor rotate as the finger gets closer to the coin. 
        Notice how the closer the finger gets to the coin, the more servo motor becomes reactive.
        When the certain threshold is reached, the motor spins up to 180 degrees.

            <p> The snippet of code in IDE that programs the motion of the servo motor 
                with the synchronization of the coin capacitor.
                As shown, two libraries: CapacitiveSensor and Servo are used.
                *Note that the value of the map function is based on the calibration: 
                According to the result shown in the serial monitor,
                the sensor's minimum value was approximately 20, wheras its maximum value was approximately 600.

      <p> The schematic of the entire circuit and showing how each components are configuered.
        Notice how each coin capacitive sensor and the servo motor is arranged independently.

      <img src="Library/Question1.jpg" />
      <p> The graph that shows the voltage at pin 9 over two seconds. 
        The line is flat, since the servo motor will have a constant voltage produced.

    <div class="header">
        <img src="Library/Question2,3.jpg" />
        <p> The calculation process for Question 2 and 3.
          Notice how errneous reading 1% and 10% can be managed by constraining the mapping value,
          with adjusted range accroding to the error percentage.
