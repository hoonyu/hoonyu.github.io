    <h1>Hoon Yu's Assignment 2 - Fade!</h1>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Fade/circuit.jpg" />
      <p>The image of circuit showing two green LEDs that turns on
        by the press of the button and one red LED that turns on by the 
        press of the button then fades.They are all configuered 
       independently.
        The Arduino microcontrollers and IDE are used to 
        program the lighting of the LEDs.  </p>


    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Fade/vid.gif" />
      <p> The animated version of thre circuit and breadboard, 
        making LEDs turn on in maximum brightness. Notice how only the red LED
        fades. Keep pressing the button will keep the lights on. 
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="header">
      <img src="Fade/fadecode.jpg" />
      <p> The snippet of code in IDE that programs the lighting of three-LEDs 
        with the synchronization of the button.
        As shown, digitalRead, digitalWrite, and analogWrite are all have used.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Fade/schematic.jpg" />
      <p> The schematic of the entire circuit and calculations for the resistance.
        Notice how each LEDs are configuered independently. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Fade/calculation.jpg" />
      <p> The resistance calculations for each LEDs and the button system.
        Three resistors of 220 ohms are used since each LEDs require a resistance
        higher than 160 ohms. For the button system, the resistor of 10k ohms is used 
        to prevent excessive current flow in the circuit. 
      </p>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Fade/question1.jpg" />
      <p> 1. A graph that answers question 1 of Additional questions.<br />

      The larger the number (0~255), the more timespan of voltage in the LED.
      </p>
      
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Fade/question2.jpg" />
      <p> 1. An explanation that answers the question 2 of Additional questions.<br />

      In conclusion, three LEDs result in total current of 68.1mA, in which
      the 1200mAh battery will last more than 17.62 hours.
