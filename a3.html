      <p>The image of the circuit showing a green LED, a blue LED that turns on
        based on the resistance feedback by the photoresistor shown on the right side.
        They are all configuered independently.
        The Arduino microcontrollers and IDE are used to 
        program the lighting of the LEDs and configuration of the voltage divider.  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Input/video.gif" />
      <p> The animated version of the circuit and breadboard, 
        making the blue LED turn when the light is blocked on the photoresistor, 
        and making the green LED turn on when the light is exposed. These two LEDs behave
        in the opposite convention. Notice how the LEDs' brightness is fading..

            <p> The snippet of code in IDE that programs the lighting of the LEDs 
                with the synchronization of the photoresistor.
                As shown, analogRead, analogWrite, map, and if-statement are all used.
                *Note that the analogRead values in the map statement as well as the constrain 
                function is based on this finding: According to the result shown in the serial monitor,
                the darklevel arranged from 221(minimum) and 660(maximum), using the calibration to
                set the values correctly.

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Input/Schematic.jpg" />
      <p> The schematic of the entire circuit and showing how each components are configuered.
        Notice how each LEDs are configuered independently, as well as the photoresistor.
      </p>
    </div>



    <div class="header">
      <img src="Input/Calculation1.jpg" />
      <p> The resistance calculations for each LEDs and the photoresistor.
        For each LED, resistors of 220 ohms are used since each LEDs require a resistance
        higher than 160 ohms. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="header">
        <img src="Input/Calculation2.jpg" />
        <p> The calculation for the fixed resistor in the voltage divider.
            Note how having 10K ohms resistor result in perfect range of voltage out value.

      <p> 1. An explanation that answers question 1 of Additional questions.<br />

      Switching the R1 and R2 variable result in the same voltage value.

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Input/Question2.jpg" />
      <p> 1. A graph that answers the question 2 of Additional questions.<br />

      Notice how as the lights are blocked on the photoresistor, its resistance increases,
      resulting in the decreasing volatge out value as they have an inverse relationship.

        <p> 1. An explanation that answers the question 3 of Additional questions.<br />
  
        Note how the range increases as the bits increases respectively. 
        I came to this conclusion as I was able to find the pattern and apply it to the current
        scheme of the map function.
